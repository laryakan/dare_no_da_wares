# DeadAir X4-Reemergence Patch (No DA Wares)

## What's different comparing to the original DeadAir-RE Patch ?
**v1.40** There is no more DA Wares in this fork, this means : 
- No Labor Union Contracts
- No Military Schematics
- No Advanced Schematics
and none of their associated production module (in this patch, specifically for OTAS)

### Disclaimer !
If you want to use this patch instead of the original one, I strongly recommends you to use it with https://github.com/laryakan/deadair_eco_no_da_wares/releases instead of the original deadair_eco !!!

Otherwise, using this version of the patch instead of the original DeadAir-RE Patch along side the original deadair_eco, the OTAS will be the only faction without the new DeadAir Wares !

In fact https://github.com/laryakan/deadair_eco_no_da_wares purpose is to remove DeadAir wares for all faction, the fork your on right know do it for the OTAS, the faction added by X4RE.

## Great thanks to DeadAir and the X4-RE Team !
I want to thank DeadAir and X4-RE Team a lot for all their work !
